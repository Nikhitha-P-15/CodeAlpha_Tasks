# CodeAlpha_Tasks

Task 1 - Basic Network Sniffer 
In my first task, I explored network packet sniffing, Using Python and the Scapy library, I developed a network sniffer capable of capturing and analyzing various packet types, offering detailed insights into network traffic. 
  🔍 Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
  📌 Real-time packet inspection
  📌 Understanding protocol layers (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
  📌 Building practical tools for cybersecurity monitoring.

Task 2 - Phishing Awareness Training
As part of Task 2 at CodeAlpha , I conducted an in-depth study of phishing, ranging from deceptive emails to sophisticated scams, gaining valuable insight into the tactics employed by cybercriminals.
This experience reinforced a key principle: awareness and vigilance are the first and most critical lines of defense against cyberattacks.
This project focused on identifying phishing techniques and educating users on how to recognize and respond to suspicious activities in the digital space.

   💡 Key Highlights:
   ✅ Studied real-world phishing tactics
   ✅ Designed an awareness interface to simulate phishing detection
   ✅ Learned how user education can strengthen cybersecurity posture
   ✅ Reinforced the importance of digital vigilance

   🛡️ In a world full of digital threats, awareness is the strongest defense.

Task 3 - Network Intrusion Detection System 
In this project, I configured Suricata to monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats by implementing custom rules and alerts, where I focused on developing a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).
As shown in the video, this project involved crafting a robust Python-based system designed to:
    🌐 Monitor network traffic in real-time for suspicious activities.
    🚨 Detect and prevent unauthorized access and security breaches.
    ⚙️ Enable dynamic rule creation and management for flexible threat response.
    ✨ Enhance overall network safety through precise data analysis and cybersecurity techniques.
     This hands-on experience has significantly deepened my expertise in:
    🔐 Network Security Engineering
    📊 Real-time Data Processing for Threat Intelligence
    🐍 Applied Python Development for Cybersecurity
    💻 User Interface Design for Security Management (as seen with the Suricata Alert Monitor)


During the one-month internship, I gained valuable experience delving into various cybersecurity tools. From sniffing packets to capturing and analyzing them, detecting alerts, visualizing data, and identifying phishing attempts, I immersed myself in a wide array of cybersecurity tasks. As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I am still eager for more experiences and opportunities for growth in this field. I am grateful to CodeAlpha for providing this insightful opportunity, as it significantly contributed to my knowledge and skill development in the field.
